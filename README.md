**Goal: To Predict the Optimum Mix of Players in the Premier League for each week
**
- How the predictions performed vs. acutals
- Some sort of front end to input your team and get transfers in and out
- Some data visualisation might be nice. How can this be served?

**Key Thoughts

- Transfers from other leagues, youth players being promoted
- Likelihood of playing
- Tracking injuries

**Key Components
**
1. Front end web accessible page with...

**Constraints - the optimsation problem
**
- 100 millon total spend
- X free transfers a week, future ones cost X points
- Wild card and other

**Tools to Deployed
**
- Looked for tools that could

**Data Sources
